# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Reviews

Performed sentiment analysis on car reviews. Each review has label "Pos" or "Neg" to give an idea of the sentiment of reviews. In this Jupyter notebook, I have implement a Naïve Bayes classifier using 80% (1106) of the reviews as training data. The training data was selected at random from the full dataset. Classifier was tested using the remaining 20% (276) of the reviews and classifier’s performance was reported using a confusion matrix.

The performance of the classifer is compared using different number of n-grams and a different types of Naive Bayes classifier.
